Predictive Model: AI-Based Dental Diagnosis
Introduction
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into dental diagnostics has revolutionized the field of dentistry, offering enhanced precision and efficiency in detecting and diagnosing multiple dental conditions. This project presents a deep learning-based system for the automated detection and diagnosis of diverse dental anomalies using YOLOv8. The system is implemented as a Flask-based web application, allowing dentists to upload radiographic images and receive diagnostic results in real time.
Data
The dataset used for training and evaluating the AI-based dental diagnosis models consists of


•	Dental Radiographs: High-resolution images collected from public datasets like kaggle.
•	Annotation: Images are annotated using the Roboflow platform, ensuring accurate and standardized labeling.
•	Preprocessing: Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustments, and noise reduction are applied to enhance model generalization.
Methodology
The dental diagnosis model follows a multi-stage process:
1. Feature Extraction (YOLOv8 CNN)
•	A pre trained YOLOv8 convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature embeddings from dental radiographs.
•	These embeddings capture essential spatial patterns to differentiate normal and abnormal dental conditions.
2. Model Training & Evaluation
•	The extracted features are used to train the YOLOv8 model.
•	The model is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (mAP).
•	Hyperparameter tuning is performed to improve accuracy.
Execution
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure required Python libraries such as TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask, and YOLOv8 are installed.
2. Setup the Environment
•	Download the dataset and store it in the specified directory.
•	Annotate the data using Roboflow or any annotation tool that supports YOLOv8 format.
3. Train the Model
Initiate the training process using the prepared dataset and model architecture.
4. Evaluate the Model
Assess the trained model's performance using standard evaluation metrics.
5. Deploy the Web Application
Launch the Flask server to enable web-based interaction with the model.
6. Upload a Radiograph Image
Users can upload a dental radiograph, and the trained model will analyze and classify anomalies.
7. View Results
The results, including detected anomalies and confidence scores, are displayed on the web interface.
 
Results
The AI-based dental diagnosis model has demonstrated high accuracy in detecting dental anomalies. The results indicate that YOLOv8 effectively identifies dental conditions with high precision, ensuring improved patient outcomes.
Conclusion
This AI-driven approach streamlines diagnostic workflows and assists dentists in making accurate decisions. The system's robust performance highlights its potential to be integrated into clinical settings, contributing to the advancement of dental healthcare.
